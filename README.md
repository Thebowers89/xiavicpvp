<h2 id="things-to-think-about">Things to think about</h2>
<ul>
<li>How are players going to get around the constructions of other players (see <strong>Possible ideas #1</strong>)</li>
<li>What materials are players going to get?</li>
<li>How are teams going to be set up? Red vs. Blue?</li>
<li>How are the capture points going to be set up?
<ul>
<li>How long is the capture duration going to be?</li>
<li>How is point contesting going to be handled?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If explosions are going to be used for structure demolition, how am I going to both enable the destruction of player structures and disable the destruction of the arena itself.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="possible-ideas">Possible ideas</h2>
<ol>
<li>Have players build with wool and have fire arrows “Burn” them.</li>
